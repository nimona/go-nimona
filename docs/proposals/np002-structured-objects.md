# Structured Objects

## Simple Summary

Objects expand on the work on [hinted object notation] and further define
the top levels of their structure in order to add some commonly used attributes
that applications can leverage.

## Problem Statement

In order for application and service developers to be able to identify, use, and
create data structures compatible with other applications we need to define a
basic list of well known attributed, some required some optional.

## Proposal

The top level of each object consists of three main attributes.

- `@type:s` is an arbitrary string defining the type of the object's content.
- `@metadata:m` are a fixed set of attributes that add extra info to the object.

```json
{
  "@type:s": "type",
  "@metadata:m": {
    "stream:s": "bah...",
    "owner:s": "bah...",
    "parents:m": [
      "*:as": ["bah..."],
      "some-type:as": ["bah..."],
    ],
    "_signature:m": {
      "alg:s": "hashing-algorithm",
      "signer:s": "bah...",
      "x:d": "bah..."
    }
  },
  "foo:s": "bar"
}
```

### Type

::: danger
Types are currently a way of moving forward, it's quite possible they will be
deprecated in the future in favor once schemes are introduced.
:::

### Well known types

- `nimona.io/crypto.PublicKey`
- `nimona.io/crypto.PrivateKey`
- `nimona.io/object.CID`
- `nimona.io/peer.ConnectionInfoInfo`
- `nimona.io/peer.ConnectionInfoRequest`
- `nimona.io/peer.ConnectionInfoResponse`
- `nimona.io/object.Certificate`
- `nimona.io/object.CertificateRequest`
- `nimona.io/exchange.ObjectRequest`
- `nimona.io/exchange.ObjectResponse`
- ...

### Metadata

- `owner:s` (optional) Public keys of the owner of the object.  
- `stream:s` (optional) Root hash of the stream the object is part of.  
- `parents:as` (optional) Array of cids of parent objects, this is used
  for streams
- `_signature:m` (optional) Cryptographic signature by the owner.

Additional metadata will be added in regards to access control and schema
specification.
