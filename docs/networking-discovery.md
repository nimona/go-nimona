# Discovery

The discovery protocol currently being used is called hyperspace and is in
its early stage and doesn't really scale, but offers a number of features
that we are really interested in and will continue improving on it until we
get it right.

The main goals for hyperspace are the following:

* Less incoming and outgoing chatter than traditional DHTs
* Ability to find providers without exposing the hash you are after
