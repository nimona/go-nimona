# Nimona

Nimona is in active development and still in very early stages of design.
It should not be considered stable, secure, or anything that sounds like
production ready design or implementation.

---

Nimonaâ€™s aim is to create a set of protocols that allows users to use
compatible applications to create and share data without being restricted
to the application that created them or having to force other users to use
the same application to access them. Users are always in control of their
relationships, their data, and who they share them with.

It provides a number of very opinionated layers from networking, messaging,
and identity management, to application level layers for managing permissioned
static or dynamic data. The various components and protocols that will enable
this network can be also used as stand alone for building decentralized and
peer to peer applications, services, or other protocols.
