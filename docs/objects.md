# Objects

Objects are the building blocks of nimona.
They make up mostly everything, both permanent and ephemeral.

They do not define how data should be encoded or decoded when being transported.
Their purpose is to be able to define structured, (relatively) strongly-typed
and self-describing data that can be transported through any means and encodings
while still being able to consistently produce the same cryptographic hash.
